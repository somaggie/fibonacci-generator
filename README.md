# fibonacci-generator
 creates a fibonacci list of numbers from a given number
 ---
I created this program as a part of a class I took this past semester, Spring 2022

What I learned
---
*more about using recursive functions and how to ensure they don't continue forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and... 

My thought process behind the work
---
1. To create this program I first looked up the fibonacci sequence.
2. A fibonacci sequence is the sum of the 2 preceding numbers.
3. I decided that a recursive function will be best to complete this task and that the number the user gives will be the start of the sequence.
